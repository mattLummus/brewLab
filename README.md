####Homebrewing Recipe Creation (and Data Logging - pushed back)

brewLab is a flexible recipe creation tool for brewing beer. It uses a comprehensive list of beer styles, ingredients, and chemical components (via the brewery_db API) to let users customize traditional beer recipes in real time.

Further releases are planned to also support autonomous data logging via a Wifi equipped Arduino.


#####Setup:

1. Bundle install and db:migrate
2. Copy config/initializers/brewerydb_example.rb and replace API key
